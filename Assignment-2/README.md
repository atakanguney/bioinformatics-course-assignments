# Burrows - Wheeler Transform and Inverse Burrows - Wheeler Transform

## Requirements
* python 3

## Run script
```bash
python3 burrows_wheeler.py
```

## Burrows - Wheeler
* After running the script, you will see options
```bash
Please enter the transform type:
    1. BW-Transform
    2. Inverse BW-Transform
(Enter 1 or 2, Please enter q to quit)
```

* Enter 1 for Burrows-Wheeler, after that you will see following

```bash
Enter a string ending with `$` to compute BW-transform:
```

* After entering your input, program should print out the transform

## Inverse Burrows - Wheeler

* Enter 2 in types menu
* After that, you will see:
```bash
Enter a string to compute inverse BW-transform:
```
* After entering your input, program should print out the inverse transform
